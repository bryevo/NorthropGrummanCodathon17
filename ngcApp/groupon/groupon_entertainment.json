Its sequel promises to elevate that gameplay with new modes, more characters, and higher levels of customizability.</p>\n\n<h5>Gameplay</h5>\n\n<p>Gamers partake in fast-paced missions which explore the bond between man and machine. Battling as either a pilot, a ruthless mercenary, or a 20-foot-tall war machine, players aim to destroy their enemy using a barrage of ballistic weapons. </p>\n\n<h5>Environment</h5>\n\n<p>Through rich, cinematic scenes players are transported into a battleground where soldier Jack Cooper and his machine-squadmate BT-7274 fight against local alien creatures and human enemies from Interstellar Manufacturing Corporation. Along the way, players must use parkour elements to solve puzzles or unlock pathways.</p>\n\n<h5>Multiplayer</h5>\n\n<p>A deep multiplayer experience incorporates six brand-new Titans, new pilot fighting capabilities, and alternative modes. Friends can play together in person or meet online for social and competitive gaming. </p>\n\n<h5>Specifics</h5>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Category: first-person shooter</li>\n  <li>System: PlayStation 4, Xbox One</li>\n  <li>Developer: Respawn Entertainment</li>\n  <li>ESRB rated M for mature</li>\n</ul>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><i>For post-purchase inquiries, please contact <a href=\"http://gr.pn/zmfvIT\">Groupon customer support</a>.\n<br /><br />\nGoods sold by Groupon Goods.

Celebrity interviews offer a glimpse into the lives of the upper echelon while simultaneously helping bridge the perceived gap that divides us. Perhaps most admirably, the magazine&#8217;s writers strive to spark conversations on more than just the standard celebrity gossip and love advice\u2014they also dig deeper into American culture to cover sometimes uncomfortable issues pertaining to women&#8217;s rights, politics, and relationships.</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>1-year, 12-issue subscription</li>\n  <li>Features on sex and relationships, beauty, politics, health, careers, celebrities, and more</li>\n  <li>Celebrity interviews and advice columns</li>\n</ul>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3dQdmT68EyB8LYcHsAvjTNovsRaF/3d-960x576/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3dQdmT68EyB8LYcHsAvjTNovsRaF/3d-960x576/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3dQdmT68EyB8LYcHsAvjTNovsRaF/3d-960x576/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3dQdmT68EyB8LYcHsAvjTNovsRaF/3d-960x576/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3dQdmT68EyB8LYcHsAvjTNovsRaF/3d-960x576/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/3dQdmT68EyB8LYcHsAvjTNovsRaF/3d-960x576/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2017-04-12T06:59:59Z","startAt":"2017-03-21T04:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2017-03-21T04:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"goods","name":"Goods"}],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"abilene","name":"Abilene, TX","timezone":"Central Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-18000,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/Chicago","lat":32.4487,"lng":-99.7331},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":false,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":false,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":null,"locationNote":null,"vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":"Code Deal","tags":[{"name":"Magazine & Newspaper","uuid":"5a6ace9c-7e80-4c45-8316-e993450d275d"},{"name":"Magazines & Newspapers","uuid":"b8e160d0-c473-44ce-9bea-c6c0c60e51f3"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"goods"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"bwfGroup":null,"merchant":{"id":"cosmo-magazine","uuid":"66d923ee-aecb-11e1-8e54-00259060b612","name":"Hearst Magazines","websiteUrl":null,"facebookUrl":null,"ratings":null,"twitterUrl":null},"options":[{"id":56942621,"uuid":"40a8e81d-f754-49f1-a99f-7a0c2292e0fc","bookable":false,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/gg-hearst-magazines-cosmopolitan/confirmation?pledge_id=56942621","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Promotional value expires 3 months from purchase date.

By anthropomorphizing numbers, letters, and colors, the DVDs help children aged 9 months to 7 years easily recognize the characters and understand their functions.

Founder Kathy Oxley has good reason to believe that toddlers can easily learn these concepts. After exposure to the alphabet, Oxley\u2019s 14-month-old daughter began to recognize letters on signs and in books. Within a year, the two-year-old could read simple words on her own. Preschool Prep\u2019s base philosophy is to provide a child with a basic set of tools, so that they have them when they are ready to learn how to read. In the end, it\u2019s a philosophy very similar to other educational approaches. \u201CWe teach toddlers to identify dogs, elephants, unicorns and dinosaurs,\u201D Oxley said in an interview with EW.com. \u201CLetters are no different. They are just animals of a different kind.\u201D </p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><i>For questions pertaining to this deal, click the Ask a Question button below.

The lesson plans used lacked multisensory learning approaches, music, and engaging content that would make learning fun. Taking matters into his own chalk-covered hands, Mr. Caudle contacted his brother Brad, a musician, and together the two recorded Rock \u2018N Learn\u2019s first program. More than 25 years and a <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1JTt5jT\">slew of awards</a> later, the company still remains a family affair. Brad\u2019s wife, Melissa, writes material and coordinates research, while Richard\u2019s wife, Kathie, manages the sales and marketing team. Together, they have created more than 50 books, audio programs, and videos.</p>\n\n<p>Rock \u2018N Learn\u2019s educational DVDs and CDs fuse music and colorful imagery to teach skills in areas such as math, science, phonics, and language. Their DVD programs give life to animated characters such as D.J. Doc, the Hip Hop Hamster, who raps positive lyrics about <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1OmljFA\">states and capitals</a> and the challenges of finding rodent-sized sunglasses. Some of Rock \u2018N Learn\u2019s other items include <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1L7cB9M\">interactive stories</a> for the iPad and iPhone as well as DVDs that cover <a href=\"http://bit.ly/1LiJNyA\">test-taking strategies</a>.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4GB83iTT2ynZTDQD8JTxWkMyyUGN/4G-960x576/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4GB83iTT2ynZTDQD8JTxWkMyyUGN/4G-960x576/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4GB83iTT2ynZTDQD8JTxWkMyyUGN/4G-960x576/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4GB83iTT2ynZTDQD8JTxWkMyyUGN/4G-960x576/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4GB83iTT2ynZTDQD8JTxWkMyyUGN/4G-960x576/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4GB83iTT2ynZTDQD8JTxWkMyyUGN/4G-960x576/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"featured","endAt":"2017-07-01T06:59:59Z","startAt":"2016-08-22T04:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2016-08-22T04:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[{"id":"goods","name":"Goods"}],"dealTypes":[{"id":"parent","name":"Good for Kids","description":"Toys and necessities for the little ones"}],"division":{"id":"abilene","name":"Abilene, TX","timezone":"Central Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-18000,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/Chicago","lat":32.4487,"lng":-99.7331},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":true,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":true,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":false,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":true,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":null,"locationNote":null,"vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":"Drop ship (Groupon small parcel)","tags":[{"name":"DVDs & Videos","uuid":"40e46ac4-4947-48f8-ac51-696939643d74"},{"name":"Movies - Kids & Family","uuid":"921e2a02-a2db-4bb5-9608-6f4606b01e77"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"goods"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"bwfGroup":null,"merchant":{"id":"rock-n-learn","uuid":"513bf176-d02a-11e1-abb1-002590604038","name":"Rock 'N Learn Educational 8-DVD Preschool Collection","websiteUrl":null,"facebookUrl":null,"ratings":null,"twitterUrl":null},"options":[{"id":48494052,"uuid":"5b4ae726-5e3d-11e6-a186-002590604002","bookable":null,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/gg-rock-n-learn-8-dvd-preschool-collection/confirmation?pledge_id=48494052","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"<ul class=\"ul-add-bullet\"><li><a href=\"http://gr.pn/1emHyte\">Free returns</a></li><li>Does not ship to PO boxes/AK/HI/Canada/Puerto Rico.</li><li>Most orders are delivered within 7 business days from the purchase date. <a href=\"http://gr.pn/1GqEQiK\">Shipping questions?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.groupon.com/faq#strike-through\">How is the strike-through price determined?</a></li></ul>"}],"discount":{"amount":8000,"currencyCode":"USD","formattedAmount":"$80.00"},"discountPercent":73,"endAt":"2017-07-01T06:59:59Z","expiresAt":"2999-01-01T00:00:00Z","expiresInDays":null,"externalUrl":null,"isLimitedQuantity":true,"isSoldOut":false,"maximumPurchaseQuantity":5,"minimumPurchaseQuantity":1,"price":{"amount":2999,"currencyCode":"USD","formattedAmount":"$29.99"},"traits":[],"redemptionLocations":[],"soldQuantity":-1,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","specificAttributes":{"takeoutDelivery":{"takeout":false,"delivery":false}},"status":"open","title":"Rock 'N Learn 8 DVD Preschool Collection","value":{"amount":10999,"currencyCode":"USD","formattedAmount":"$109.99"},"customFields":[]}],"salesforceLink":null,"says":null}],"facets":[],"pagination":{"offset":0,"count":245},"relevanceService":{"persistentRanking":"updated","context":"web_all","treatment":"3e203a15-2002-01db-bb1d-2ed729667dfb"},"dealSubsetAttributes":[]}
