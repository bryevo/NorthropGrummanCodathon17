Over the years, hundreds of elite sumo wrestlers have stomped into the event and competed for glory during more than 1,000 matches. The 2017 installment will only add to those numbers, with more than 60 competitors from all over the world scheduled to clash in over 100 matches\u2014including openweight bouts where 150-pound wrestlers take on 500-pound opponents. Of course, large as they are, those numbers won&#8217;t be the biggest part of the afternoon. Here are a few competitors you should keep an eye on: </p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Byamba:</strong> A four-time World Sumo champion, Byamba has dominated this tournament by claiming gold medals every year from 2007 to 2014. In 2015, he was overthrown in both the heavyweight and openweight competitions. In 2016, he reclaimed glory, with a 13-0 record, winning both heavyweight and openweight divisions, undefeated.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p><strong>Roy Sims:</strong> For 15 years, no American had ever won top honors in the US Sumo Open&#8217;s heavyweight or openweight division\u2014that is, until 2015, when Roy Sims earned openweight gold, demonstrating just how unpredictable the tournament can be.

This modern twist on the Brothers Grimm brings together Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Jack (of beanstalk fame), a Baker, his Wife and, of course, the Witch. The beloved storybook characters take on startling complexity as they discover that wishes come with a price. Witches, wolves, giants and mysterious strangers force the heroes to face the music and their future in a world where everything doesn&#39;t always end happily. Spring Valley&#39;s ENCORE! Theatre&#39;s new production is a humorous and heartfelt chase through the woods, featuring two separate youth casts and such unforgettable songs as &#34;No One Is Alone,&#34; &#34;Children Will Listen&#34; and &#34;Giants in the Sky.&#34;</p><strong>The tickets identified in this promotion are made available through Goldstar.
