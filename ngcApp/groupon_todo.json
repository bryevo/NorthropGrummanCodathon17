Read on for some tips on finding the ideal pair.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Binoculars are basically two telescopes stuck together.</strong> Each side is made up of a convex lens that magnifies distant objects and a prism that flips that image so it appears right-side up. Unlike the flat image of a telescope, however, the two images presented by binoculars give the illusion of depth, making it easier to get detailed, up-close views of a rare bird or an especially challenging <em>Magic Eye</em> poster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Bigger is not always better.</strong> Binoculars are characterized by two numbers, such as 8x32. The first number describes the magnification\u2014in this case, the image is enlarged eight times\u2014and the second describes the diameter (in millimeters) of the objective lens, located at the wide end of the tube. Although increased magnification produces a sharper image, it also narrows the field of view and amplifies small hand movements, making it difficult to keep the image steady and follow moving objects. A larger objective lens lets more light in, producing a brighter image, but it can also make the binoculars a burden to carry on long treks. </p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Different activities require different binoculars.</strong> Just as opera glasses are different from the coin-op viewfinders of Broadway theaters, the type of binoculars you\u2019ll need will vary based on the activity. Consider different variables when selecting a pair such as larger lenses for detailed bird watching or a more compact design for casual walking tours.

Hop back in time as Groupon explores the most famous swing move of all\u2014the Lindy Hop.</em></p>\n\n<p>As a big band plays hot and fast jazz from the bandstand, feet move in a flurry on the dance floor, a couple&#8217;s hands and arms loosely clasped in a casual take on a ballroom embrace. Suddenly the lead dancer drops his arm from his partner&#8217;s waist, and the two face the audience to kick and twist their feet in sync, hands still clasped, before returning to their original position. This move, called the swingout, forms the basis of the Lindy Hop, an upbeat partner dance that incorporates the footwork of the Charleston as well as jazz-inspired steps. The former\u2019s wild, frenzied kicks are a signature of the Lindy Hop, as are acrobatic flips\u2014particularly during exhibitions or performances that encourage a bit of showing off.\u00A0</p>\n\n<p>Now thought of as one of the original styles of swing, the Lindy Hop has a history as wild as its own fleet-footed moves. The dance was definitely born in Harlem&#8217;s Savoy Ballroom in the mid-1920s, though no one knows for sure how the name came about; many credit dancer &#8220;Shorty&#8221; George Snowden with coining it as a reference to pilot Charles Lindbergh&#8217;s 1927 &#8220;hop&#8221; across the Atlantic. Regardless, Shorty George and his professional Lindy Hop troupe wowed the crowds at the Savoy\u2014one of the first integrated dance clubs in New York City\u2014to a live soundtrack of jazz greats such as Chuck Webb, Duke Ellington, and Ella Fitzgerald. Decades before the Civil Rights Era, crowds of black and white Americans bridged the cultural divide as they cut loose with the unifying rapture of swing, which itself fused the decorum of European ballroom dancing with the improvisational glee of African-style dance.\u00A0</p>\n\n<p>A disciple of Shorty George, Frank Manning, changed the Lindy game in 1935 when he flipped partner Frieda Washington over his back on the floor of the Savoy. It was the first aerial step\u2014the dance had finally come full circle from its alleged inspiration in Charles Lindbergh. Now famous for his antics, Manning traveled the world with the Savoy-based group Whitey&#8217;s Lindy Hoppers, even appearing in Hollywood films such as the Marx Brothers&#8217; <em>A Day at the Races</em>. But with the advent of rock and roll, swing\u2019s popularity began to wane, and Manning faded into obscurity. Until, that is, the form enjoyed an international resurgence in the 1980s, and dancers in America and Sweden tracked down the surviving members of Whitey&#8217;s Lindy Hoppers hoping to learn the steps from the masters themselves. Now revered by a new generation, Manning emerged from retirement to teach and perform once again, traveling to Sweden to lead classes at the annual Herr\u00E4ng Dance Camp\u2014one of the largest swing events in the world today.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4YVBmhXSmbUVQMEHweRBYaPKKa5P/4Y-1500x900/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4YVBmhXSmbUVQMEHweRBYaPKKa5P/4Y-1500x900/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4YVBmhXSmbUVQMEHweRBYaPKKa5P/4Y-1500x900/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4YVBmhXSmbUVQMEHweRBYaPKKa5P/4Y-1500x900/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4YVBmhXSmbUVQMEHweRBYaPKKa5P/4Y-1500x900/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/deal/4YVBmhXSmbUVQMEHweRBYaPKKa5P/4Y-1500x900/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"extended","endAt":"2041-01-25T07:59:59Z","startAt":"2016-09-21T07:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2016-09-20T07:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[],"dealTypes":[],"division":{"id":"los-angeles","name":"Los Angeles","timezone":"Pacific Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-25200,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/Los_Angeles","lat":34.0522,"lng":-118.243},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":false,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":true,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"DTLA","locationNote":"","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Dance Class","uuid":"5ac3018c-449a-4408-9a09-3fab1aae0dbc"},{"name":"Courses - Sports Training","uuid":"bafa426f-d3a8-46f5-b642-95cedf3b53e1"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"other"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"bwfGroup":null,"merchant":{"id":"the-lindy-loft","uuid":"f5ca7e70-d104-683d-1c88-f9c0974cecbe","name":"Lindy Loft","websiteUrl":"http://www.lindyloft.com","twitterUrl":null,"facebookUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":48149165,"uuid":"e9da7e1e-f528-4980-968b-c99bd7421667","bookable":null,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/lindy-loft/confirmation?pledge_id=48149165","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Limit 1 per person, may buy 1 additional as a gift.

Check out Groupon\u2019s guide to these educational art materials.</em></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. The first crayons cost less than 1 cent each.</strong> The first boxes of Crayola crayons sold in 1903 cost a nickel. Each box contained eight colors: red, orange, yellow, green, blue, violet, brown, and black. As of 2014, Crayola makes a total of 120 colors, including 23 varieties of red alone.\u00A0</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. They have a distinct smell.</strong> According to a Yale study, crayons are the 18th most recognizable smell to American adults. Topping the list: coffee and peanut butter.\u00A0</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Sure, you can eat them.</strong> Just as the crayons themselves are nontoxic, Crayola\u2019s paper labels use a glue made from cornstarch and water, making them safe\u2014though not advisable\u2014to consume. Before the company used machines to apply the labels, local farmers used to do it by hand as a way to supplement their income during the winter.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Crayons are a national treasure.</strong> In 1958, Crayola wowed the coloring world with a box of 64 colors as well as a built-in crayon sharpener\u2014an innovation that earned it a place in the National Museum of American History, right next to the original draft of the Constitution scrawled in magic marker.</p>","soldQuantity":-1,"limitedQuantityRemaining":null,"tippingPoint":0,"soldQuantityMessage":"-1","placeholderUrl":"https://secure-assets.grouponcdn.com/images/groupon/grayPlaceholder.png","grid4ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/iam/pR34ALQQghfoW8snczDV/Da-2048x1229/v1/t300x182.jpg","grid6ImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/iam/pR34ALQQghfoW8snczDV/Da-2048x1229/v1/t460x279.jpg","largeImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/iam/pR34ALQQghfoW8snczDV/Da-2048x1229/v1/t440x300.jpg","mediumImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/iam/pR34ALQQghfoW8snczDV/Da-2048x1229/v1/t100x100.jpg","smallImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/iam/pR34ALQQghfoW8snczDV/Da-2048x1229/v1/t50x50.jpg","sidebarImageUrl":"https://img.grouponcdn.com/iam/pR34ALQQghfoW8snczDV/Da-2048x1229/v1/t200x300.jpg","status":"open","type":"groupon","accessType":"extended","endAt":"2039-05-01T07:00:00Z","startAt":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","tippedAt":"2014-12-30T08:00:00Z","areas":[],"channels":[],"dealTypes":[{"id":"always-learning","name":"Always Learning","description":"Edifying activities to expand your horizons"},{"id":"do-it-yourselfer","name":"Crafty","description":"Explore your creativity"}],"division":{"id":"los-angeles","name":"Los Angeles","timezone":"Pacific Daylight Time","timezoneOffsetInSeconds":-25200,"timezoneIdentifier":"America/Los_Angeles","lat":34.0522,"lng":-118.243},"grouponRating":null,"allowedInCart":false,"isInviteOnly":false,"shippingAddressRequired":false,"isOptionListComplete":true,"isMerchandisingDeal":false,"isNowDeal":false,"isSoldOut":false,"isTipped":true,"isTravelBookableDeal":false,"isGliveInventoryDeal":false,"isAutoRefundEnabled":false,"isGiftable":true,"placementPriority":"nearby","redemptionLocation":"East LA","locationNote":"","vip":"","fulfillmentMethod":null,"tags":[{"name":"Courses - Entertainment Media / Arts","uuid":"3619e63a-3875-4b2e-93d5-49d7d4a0088b"},{"name":"Knitting & Sewing Class","uuid":"c73dfc6b-943b-4789-9adf-288d7f6aefd9"}],"displayOptions":[{"name":"discount","enabled":true},{"name":"quantity","enabled":true},{"name":"timer","enabled":true},{"name":"merchandisingType","value":"other"},{"name":"showRedemptionLocations","enabled":true},{"name":"showPrice","enabled":true}],"textAd":{"line1":"","line2":"","headline":""},"bwfGroup":null,"merchant":{"id":"lottie-da-studio","uuid":"e615cc16-b148-421e-8846-e9f0a59c5811","name":"Lottie Da Studio","websiteUrl":"http://www.lottiedastudio.com","twitterUrl":null,"facebookUrl":null,"ratings":null},"options":[{"id":12084892,"uuid":"68595ad8-fc41-36b8-b0c7-dbf16e58ec25","bookable":null,"buyUrl":"https://www.groupon.com/deals/lottie-da-studio/confirmation?pledge_id=12084892","customField":null,"details":[{"description":"Valid only within 20 miles of zip code 90026.
